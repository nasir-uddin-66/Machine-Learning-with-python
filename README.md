# Machine Learning with Python

This repository contains beginner-friendly implementations of supervised machine learning algorithms using Python. All code is written and executed in Google Colab, and the focus is on understanding the fundamentals of machine learning through practical examples.

## 📌 Algorithms Implemented

- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Support Vector Machine**

## 📁 Dataset Information

The datasets used in this project were sourced from public tutorials on YouTube and are intended for educational purposes only. They cover various small-scale examples suitable for learning.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

The following Python libraries were used:

- `numpy`  
- `pandas`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `scikit-learn`

## 📚 Learning Focus

This project is part of my journey into machine learning, specifically focusing on **supervised learning** techniques. Each algorithm is implemented from scratch or using `scikit-learn` to help solidify core concepts.

## 📓 Environment

- Platform: Google Colab  
- Language: Python 3.x
